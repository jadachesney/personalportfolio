                            I am currently a Computer Science student at Sheffield Hallam University, United Kingdom.
                            Deciding to switch my degree a year into university was daunting at first, but I have loved
                            every second of it.<br>
                            I remember the feeling of excitement and intimidation that arose during my first lecture. I
                            had zero previous coding experience, unlike my peers who seemed to have a few years under
                            their belt. This only made me more determined to learn as much as I could.<br>
                            During my first year I created multiple projects for my classes, in which resulted me
                            finishing the year with a <b>1st class final grade.</b> As an international student, this
                            was such an accomplishing feeling to know I came so far and learned so much already.<br>
                            I am now in my second year, where I have begun to learn <b>C++ and Python.</b> Alongside
                            learning these technical skills, I believe the most invaluable skill I have been able to
                            improve on is <b>communication and teamwork.</b> I have been very fortunate to learn from my
                            amazing peers and lecturers, who have been the highlight of my university experience.

                            I completed my first year of Business Management before deciding to switch to Computer
                            Science.<br> During my first year I wrote a business analysis report on NVIDIA, studied math
                            relating to accounting, and was taught how to communicate and make decisions in a working
                            environment.<br>
                            Taking a year of business studies helped bridge the gap between my coding skills and the
                            entrepreneurial skills needed to launch a startup in the future. I gained valuable knowledge
                            in areas such as <b>market research and financial management.</b><br>
                            This course, combined with what I learnt in my second semester of computer science,
                            strengthened my understanding of how I can turn my coding projects into a viable business.
