            <h1>HTML</h1>
          </div>
          <p> I was taught HTML in my first semester of University for my Databases & The Web class. For this class we were tasked to create our first
            online website for a final assessment, and we were taught how to link it to a database and have full responsiveness. In my second semester, we worked
            on building an EER Calculator website. Ever since, I have been following online labs and tutorials to improve my HTML skills. Alongside this, I have also been
            teaching myself mobile web development. My university courses solely focused on formatting for windows portview, so while I developed this website I kept it in
            mind to make it mobile friendly as well.

            <h1>CSS</h1>
          </div>
          <p>I was introduced to CSS during my first semester of University in the Databases & The Web class. As part of the final assessment, 
            I was required to style my first online website, focusing on design, layout, and responsive elements to ensure a seamless user experience.
            We were taught how to style elements dynamically and to ensure cross-browser compatibility. In my second semester, I applied my CSS knowledge to help build an EER Calculator website.
            Since then, I have been consistently following online tutorials and labs to enhance my CSS skills, particularly in areas like flexbox, grid layouts, animations, and transitions.

          <p>I was introduced to JavaScript during the process of developing this website, although I am still in the early stages of learning and exploring the language.
            During the early stages of development for my portfolio, I had followed a few JavaScript tutorials online to help navigate areas I could use it in to show my understanding.
            Later on, I opted out of using my first draft of my portfolio and went to develop a new one. In my original plan, I had used JavaScript to create dynamic rotating text on my index page.

          </div>
          <p>I began working with PHP in my Databases & The Web class, where I used it to connect websites to databases.
            I applied PHP in combination with SQL to build dynamic and data-driven websites. In my EER Calculator Website and the Databases & The Web project,
            I used PHP to enable server-side functionality, such as retrieving, displaying, and managing data stored in a database.
            Through PHP, I implemented features such as a search bar, the ability to add, delete, edit, and create new employee records, and efficiently handled user input and data validation.
            This provided a seamless connection between the websites front end and the back end.

          <p>C++ is the core focus of my second year at university, building on the foundational C# skills I developed in my first year.
            Transitioning to C++ has been an exciting challenge, and I’ve particularly enjoyed learning it due to its widespread use in both general software development and game development,
            an area I find especially intriguing and would love to pursue in my free time. Although I have just begun development with C++, I aim to have a solid understanding
            of the language by the time this semester is completed. With my current knowledge of C++, I have been able to start learning Unity and Unreal Engine to create games.

          <p>
            I will be learning Python in-depth during the second semester of my second year, focusing on AI and machine learning.
            Currently, I have a basic understanding of Python, including familiarity with syntax, and simple scripting.
            While I’m still in the early stages of learning,
            I look forward to leveraging Python's versatility and ease of use for developing intelligent systems and solving complex problems in these fields.
            Alongside my University course, I have been reading "Learn Python in One Day" and discussing the language with my international friends who study Python at their university.

          <p>
            I was introduced to SQL in my Databases & The Web course, where I quickly developed a solid understanding of managing relational databases. SQL is one of my strongest languages, and I enjoy working with databases to efficiently organize, query, and manipulate data.
            While working with Dockridge Digital, I gained hands-on experience in database management and optimization, deepening my knowledge of advanced queries and database design. Additionally, I led the database creation and management for the EER Calculator Website, expanding my experience with databases in a collaborative setting.

          <p>C# was the first programming language I learned, and it remains the one I am most proficient in. I continue to use C# in my second year, building on the skills I gained in my first year. 
            My experience with C# has given me a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, and its a language I feel confident working with.
            One of the key projects I developed was a console-based main menu application that ran four other applications within it. This project enhanced my understanding of C#'s structure, logic, and flow control,
           as well as how to manage and integrate multiple programs within a single system. I currently am confident in console based and WinForms development.</p>

          <p>I was taught x86 Assembly in my first semester of university for my Computer Architecture class. I particularly enjoyed learning x86 due to my keen interest in computer hardware,
            and building computers. It challenged me to learn more about the actual coding of the hardware I was used to working with, particularly CPU's. In this class we focused on CPU hardware
            and the code behind them, but outside of class I am well versed on multiple PC components such as GPUs, PSUs, Motherboards, and Ram. I have built a few of my own computers and
            have taken time to research them.

          <p>Teamwork is one of my core strengths, and I’ve demonstrated this in various group projects, including the EER Calculator project. I believe that effective collaboration and communication are key to achieving successful outcomes
            Throughout the project, I worked closely with my teammates to ensure we stayed on track and supported one another in meeting our goals.
            One particular instance where I showed strong teamwork was when another member of our group struggled to complete a legal report on our system.
            At the last minute, two other students and I stepped in to help finish the report, dividing the tasks and working efficiently to meet the deadline.
            I believe that teamwork is an essential skill in a working environment and being able to communicate effectively with others.

          <p>
            I believe that communication is the most essential aspect of any successful work environment. Clear, open communication helps drive collaboration, resolve issues, and keep everyone aligned toward a common goal.
            I’ve demonstrated strong communication skills by taking the lead in group projects, ensuring that tasks were clearly delegated and progress was consistently discussed and reviewed.
            Additionally, I hosted the Course Rep Autumn Social, which involved organizing and facilitating conversations among students and faculty, further enhancing my ability to engage with a wide range of people.
            My networking skills have also been a key part of my communication abilities, allowing me to build meaningful connections and exchange knowledge effectively.

            <h1>Adaptable</h1>
          </div>
          <p>Adaptability is one of my key strengths, and I’ve demonstrated it in both personal and professional situations. At 18, I moved to a new country by myself to start university, quickly adapting to a new environment, culture, and lifestyle while managing my studies.
            This experience taught me how to thrive in unfamiliar situations and handle change with resilience.
            In my current job with National Trust, I consistently showcase my adaptability, especially during busy periods. With the fast-paced nature of the work, I often need to think on my feet, adjust to shifting priorities, and remain calm under pressure.
            Whether it's managing customer service, solving unexpected problems, or handling a high volume of tasks, I adapt quickly to ensure everything runs smoothly.
